**Project Title:**
An Implementation of Non-parametric Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Comparison with Global Logistic Regression and Other Nonparametric Classification Approaches

**Abstract:**
For medical data with binary outcome, logistical regression model is often used for binary classification. However, this parametric approach highly depends on the correctness of the pre-defined model and may not full capture the local pattern of the real-world dataset. In order to further explore this problem, several nonparametric models are implemented on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set: additive logistic regression mode, k-nearest neighborhood method and conditional inference trees. ROC curves are drawn to compare the accuracy of outcome prediction between the parametric method and several nonparametric methods.
